          BearonUI is part of Bearon Open Source Project that has goal to unify
          and generalize UI frameworks. While there's a lot of mature frameworks
          such as Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, it's not well suited for
          an enterprise projects which leads to many big companies starts to
          create their own UI framework that suit their usecase and application.

          BearonUI acts as an UI framework Foundation which is composable,
          customizable, and most importantly easy to understand as there's no
          complex functional dependencies. This is useful for beginner to
          understand how React component function works, as well for startup and
          companies to develop their own UI framwork.

          It must be noted that BearonUI does not cover all usecases and full
          customizations. As companies have their own requirement and use cases,
          BearonUI only provides the basic requirements and usecases that
          already cover 90% of all applications based on the UI research
