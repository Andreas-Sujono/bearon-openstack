âœ¨ **We're not just another framework**

BearonUI is part of **Bearon Open Source Project (BearonOS)** that aims to unify and generalize UI frameworks. While there are a lot of mature frameworks such as Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI and they are all designed for small and enterprise levels, Many companies have started to create their UI framework that suits their use cases and applications.
